This is the test for git commit / push / pull / fetch.
First, I've tested commit and push to git-hub.
Now, I'll test pull to vscode. start!
OK, success. 
maybe push process is that:
1. In vscode, write your code and store in local repository.
2. Enter the source control(ctrl+shift+G)
3. Do stagitlqng what you want to commit 


Next, I need to know 'How I using for branch?'
Let's test.
